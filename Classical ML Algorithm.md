# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
```
ANN is one of the oldest AI paradigms that has been applied to bearing fault diagnostics for almost 
30 years.
The bearing wear of the motor is reflected in the damping coefficient B that can be inferred from a 
nonlinear mapping of the stator current I and the rotor speed W.
The complexity of obtaining an analytical expression for this nonlinear mapping is avoided by 
training asupervised neural network with stator current and motor speed measurements as input and 
predicted bearing condition as output.










ANN在近三十年來一直用於bearing fault diagnostics，為最古老的AI範例之一。
電動機的軸承磨損反映在阻尼係數B(damping coefficient B)中，該阻尼係數B(damping coefficient B)可從定子電流I(stator current I)和轉子速率(rotor speed W)的非線性映射推導出來。
通過訓練以定子電流(damping coefficient)和電動機速度測量值作為輸入，並以預測的軸承狀態作為輸出的監督神經網絡，可以避免為該非線性映射獲取解析表達式的複雜性。

# Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
```
PCA is an algorithm that reveals the internal structure of the data in a way that best explains the 
variance in the data.
If a multivariate dataset is visualized as a set of coordinates in a high-dimensional data space 
(one axis per variable),
PCA can supply the user with a lower-dimensional projection of this object viewed from its most 
informative viewpoint.
Since the sensitivity of various features that are characteristics of a bearing defect may vary 
considerably at different operating conditions,
PCA has proven itself as an effective and systematic feature selection scheme that provides guidance 
on manually choosing the most representative features for classification purposes.











PCA是一種可以最好地解釋數據的差異來揭示數據的內部結構。
如果將多變量數據集(multivariate dataset)視為在高維(high-dimensional)數據空間的一組坐標(每個變量一個軸)，
則PCA可以為用戶提供該對像從其最有用的角度來看的低維(lower-dimensional)投影。 
由於作為軸承缺陷特徵的各種特徵的靈敏度在不同的操作條件下可能會發生很大變化，
因此PCA已證明自己是一種有效且系統的特徵選擇方案，可為分類目的手動選擇最具代表性的特徵提供指導。

# K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
```
The k-NN algorithm is a non-parametric method used for either classification or regression.
k-NN serves as the core algorithm for a data mining based ceramic bearing fault classifier 
based on acoustic signals.








k-NN算法是用於分類或回歸的非參數方法。
k-NN是基於聲信號的基於數據挖掘的陶瓷軸承故障分類器的核心算法。

# Support Vector Machines (SVM)
```
SVM are supervised learning models 
that analyze data used for non-probabilistic classification or regression analysis.









SVM是有監督的學習模型，可以分析用於非概率分類或回歸分析的數據。
