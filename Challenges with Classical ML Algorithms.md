# Sliding
```
The fault frequency is based on the assumption that no sliding occurs between the rolling element
and the bearing raceway,i.e., these rolling elements will only roll on the raceway. Nevertheless,
this is seldom the case in reality,as the rolling element often undergoes a combination of rolling 
and sliding movement. 
As a consequence, the calculated frequency may deviate from the real fault frequency and make this 
manually determined feature less informative of a bearing defect.








故障頻率是建立在滾動元件和軸承滾道之間不會發生滑動，即這些滾動元件僅在滾道上滾動。 
然而，實際上很少這樣，因為滾動元件經常經歷滾動和滑動運動的組合。 
結果，計算出的頻率可能會偏離實際的故障頻率，並使此手動確定的特徵對軸承缺陷的信息較少。
```

# Frequency interplay
```
If multiple types of bearing faults occur simultaneously, these faults will interact and the 
resultant characteristic frequencies can add or subtract due to a complicated electro-mechanical 
process, thereby obfuscating the informative frequencies.








如果同時發生多種類型的軸承故障，
則這些故障將相互作用，並且由於復雜的機電過程，
導致的特徵頻率可能會增加或減少，從而使信息頻率變得模糊。
